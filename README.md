Saeed Ahmad's Personal Portfolio
A modern, responsive, and visually appealing personal portfolio website crafted to showcase my skills and professional journey as a web developer. It's built with a strong focus on clean code, a seamless user experience, and a professional aesthetic.

Features
Dynamic and Engaging Homepage: The landing page features a captivating "auto-typing" animation, which provides a personalized welcome message.

Smooth and Intuitive Navigation: A well-structured navigation bar allows for effortless scrolling to different sections of the page. On smaller screens, it transforms into a responsive hamburger menu for a clean mobile experience.

Clear Skill Showcase: A dedicated section highlights my core technical skills, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, presented with progress bars for visual representation.

Project Gallery: A section dedicated to showcasing my key projects, complete with placeholder images, brief descriptions, and links to live demos and source code.

Clean and Professional Design: The site utilizes a dark color palette and a minimalist layout to create a professional and modern look. Hover effects and smooth transitions add a layer of interactivity without distracting from the content.

Contact Form: A functional contact form to facilitate easy communication for collaborations and opportunities.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For the fundamental structure and semantic content of the website.

CSS3: For all styling, including custom layouts, responsive design, animations, and visual enhancements.

JavaScript (ES6+): For interactive elements, dynamic content, and overall client-side functionality.
